The Constitution protects specific individual rights like freedom of speech, the right to privacy, and freedom of religion from intrusion by the government. The Constitution does not place age requirements on these freedoms. Despite the court rulings that have limited student rights, the ACLU believes that all individuals, including young people, should enjoy these basic rights.Teachers and administrators have a responsibility to provide a safe environment for the students that is conducive to learning. They also have a responsibility to respect each student's individual rights. These two missions are not incompatible. Young people have rights too!
